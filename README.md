# Blog_API
Blogging REST API with JWT-based authentication system in TypeScript. Uses *Express*, *SQLite* on the backend, *Jest* with *supertest* for integration tests.


Currently implemented:
-
- Creating an account (/user/register)
- Logging in and responding with an access_token 
- Secure routes that require authorization (/create/posts)
- Authorization middleware that verifies and decodes the token, extracts information from JWT payload
- Integration tests
- Configured to run with TypeScript and compile code/restart Node at every save
